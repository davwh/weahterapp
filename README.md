https://blueweather-app.netlify.app/

For the app to work properly you need to provide permissions for the location of your browser.
After that, preferably specifying the nationality of the location (as shown in photo) you intend to search for, you can:
- Quickly get the current weather of the city of interest and the current weather conditions, such as Temperature, Pressure, Humidity, Wind speed and Feels like temperature.
- Forecast for the next 5 days.

The app works by getting information from OpenWeatherMap API
